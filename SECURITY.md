## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Parameterized queries
const result = await conn.execute(
  'SELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE id = ?',
  [vehicleId]
);

// ‚ùå Bad: String concatenation
const result = await conn.execute(
  `SELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE id = '${vehicleId}'`
);
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Use environment variables for secrets
VITE_TIDB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded secrets in code
const password = "hardcoded-password";
```

#### AI Input Validation
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Validate and sanitize AI inputs
function validateAIInput(input: string): string {
  return input
    .replace(/[<>]/g, '') // Remove potential HTML
    .substring(0, 1000)   // Limit length
    .trim();              // Remove whitespace
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Direct AI input without validation
const result = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userInput }]
});
```
