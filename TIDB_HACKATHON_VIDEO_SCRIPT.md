## üí° **TiDB Serverless Architecture (0:40 - 1:00)**

**[Screen: Technical architecture diagram with TiDB Serverless at center]**

**Narrator**: "At the heart of LogiFlow AI is TiDB Serverless with VECTOR(1536) columns. We store vehicle telemetry, route data, and emergency events with vector embeddings, then use VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE for semantic similarity search to find patterns across millions of logistics data points."

**[Screen: Code snippet showing vector search query]**
```sql
SELECT vehicle_id, VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE(embedding, ?) as similarity_score
FROM vehicles ORDER BY similarity_score ASC LIMIT 5
```

## ü§ñ **Multi-Step AI Agent #1: Predictive Maintenance (1:00 - 1:30)**

**[Screen: Predictive Maintenance workflow running live]**

**Narrator**: "Watch our first AI agent in action. Step 1: Ingest vehicle telemetry into TiDB Serverless with vector embeddings. Step 2: Search for similar vehicle patterns using vector similarity. Step 3: Chain LLM calls for AI maintenance analysis. Step 4: Automatically schedule maintenance events. Step 5: Complete the multi-step workflow with actionable recommendations."

**[Visual: Step-by-step animation of the workflow with real data]**

**[Screen: Results showing "94% AI decision accuracy, $45,000 monthly savings"]**

**Narrator**: "The result? 94% prediction accuracy and $45,000 in monthly cost savings through intelligent automation."

## üó∫Ô∏è **Multi-Step AI Agent #2: Route Optimization (1:30 - 2:00)**

**[Screen: Route Optimization agent with map visualization]**

**Narrator**: "Our second agent handles intelligent route optimization. It collects route data, indexes it with vector embeddings in TiDB, searches for similar successful routes using vector similarity, uses GPT-4 for optimization analysis, and updates systems with recommendations."

**[Visual: Map showing route optimization in real-time with vector search results]**

**[Screen: Performance metrics - "15% efficiency gain, $2,400 daily savings"]**

**Narrator**: "15% efficiency gains and $2,400 daily savings through AI-powered route intelligence backed by TiDB Serverless vector search."

## üö® **Multi-Step AI Agent #3: Emergency Response (2:00 - 2:30)**

**[Screen: Emergency Response Coordinator in action]**

**Narrator**: "Our third agent coordinates emergency response. When emergencies occur, it logs events with vector embeddings, searches similar incident patterns in TiDB, generates AI response strategies, and automatically dispatches the nearest vehicles."

**[Visual: Emergency scenario with automatic vehicle dispatch and vector similarity matching]**

**[Screen: Response time metrics - "30 seconds from detection to dispatch"]**

**Narrator**: "From emergency detection to vehicle dispatch in under 30 seconds - that's the power of TiDB Serverless vector search combined with multi-step AI automation."

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Innovation Deep Dive (2:30 - 3:00)**

**[Screen: TiDB Serverless dashboard with vector operations]**

**Narrator**: "Here's what makes this innovative: We're using TiDB Serverless VECTOR columns with cosine similarity search, JSON metadata storage for complex logistics data, real-time vector embedding generation with OpenAI, and chained LLM calls for complex multi-step reasoning."

**[Visual: Code snippets showing vector operations, database schema, AI integration]**

**[Screen: Architecture diagram highlighting TiDB ‚Üí Vector Search ‚Üí AI Chains ‚Üí Actions]**

**Narrator**: "This isn't just a logistics app - it's a showcase of how TiDB Serverless vector search enables truly intelligent, multi-step AI agents."

## üìä **Results & Impact (3:00 - 3:20)**

**[Screen: Dashboard showing impressive metrics]**

**Narrator**: "The results speak for themselves: 97% automation success rate, $45,000 monthly cost savings, 1,247 AI decisions processed daily, and complete end-to-end workflows that require zero human intervention."

**[Visual: Animated counters showing impressive metrics]**

**[Screen: Live demo of all three agents working simultaneously]**

**Narrator**: "But the real innovation is in the multi-step workflows - each agent chains together data ingestion, vector search, LLM analysis, and automated actions in a single, seamless process powered by TiDB Serverless."
